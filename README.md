# FeedbackCollectionApp

The project is to build a web application that allows a startup company’s manager to collect feedbacks from their own users by sending emails. The name of this application is “ClearFeedback”. This application helps the manager improve their company’s product/service. The user of this application we are building is the company manager. The manager will use this app to get feedback from his/her own users. The startup company has its own product/app and want to gather feedback when this product usage decreases. This application is a full stack web application that consists of client-side, server-side and database. We will use React, Redux on the client-side and Express.js, Node.js on the server side. We will use MySQL for database. This app stores all the different surveys and all emails in the database and communicate with React application through Express/Node API. Express/Node and React app will communicate through HTTP requests. Backend server will create and send emails. We can contain billing information of user of this app because sending emails might not be free of charge. For that, we also need user authentication process and payment process from users. We will use Heroku for deployment.
